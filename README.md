# Batch_Processor

The scope of this project was to build a tool that parses and executes a batch file containing a number of commands. A batch file, or batch, contains one or more commands that are executed sequentially. Each command executed by the batch processor will be executed as a process and communicate (pass information) using files or pipes.
